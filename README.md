    warden:
      args:
        cluster: "pivot-cluster"  # set current cluster name
```

  pivotKubeConfig: xx # pivot cluster kubeconfig base64

warden:
  containers:
    warden:
      args:
        inMemberCluster: true
        cluster: "member-cluster"  # set current cluster name
```

```console
helm install warden -n kubecube-system --create-namespace ./kubecube-chart -f ./member-value.yaml
```

## Uninstalling the Chart
> **Note**: not found error can be ignored. 

### Before helm uninstall

```console
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations kubecube-validating-webhook-configuration warden-validating-webhook-configuration kubecube-monitoring-admission
```

To uninstall/delete the `kubecube` helm release in namespace `kubecube-system`:


### Uninstall KubeCube in control plane
```console
helm uninstall kubecube -n kubecube-system
```

### Uninstall Warden in member cluster
```console
helm uninstall warden -n kubecube-system
```

### After helm uninstall

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

> **Note**: There are some RBAC resources that are used by the `preJob` that can not be deleted by the `uninstall` command above. You might have to clean them manually with tools like `kubectl`.  You can clean them by commands:

```console
kubectl delete sa/kubecube-pre-job -n kubecube-system
kubectl delete clusterRole/kubecube-pre-job 
kubectl delete clusterRoleBinding/kubecube-pre-job
kubectl delete ns kubecube-system hnc-system kubecube-monitoring
```
